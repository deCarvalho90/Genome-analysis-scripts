# Genome-analysis-scripts
Python scripts to help comparative genomics analyses

Scripts in this folder:
a) get_gene_equivalent_corresponding.py - Compares the genomes (CDS) of the same species and searches for single nucleotide variations between corresponding genes.
b) recip_finder_tetraploids - Uses a LASTZ output file between 2 species where one of them is an allotetraploid and looks for the 2 best hits of the allotetrapoid (compared to the other species).
c) permutation_test_gene_expression - Performs a permutation test using gene expression data to check if the expression of a certain gene is higher or lower than expected.
